What is a Node module?
- A node module is a reusable block of code that can perform various actions/tasks when called/invoked

What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
- module.exports holds the object that `require()` returns
- exports is only a reference pointing to that object, so reassignments of exports will be out of scope elsewhere.

Why is using exports recommended?
- because it's more convenient. You would only use module.exports if you want to assign a specific object type.
